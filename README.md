# python_project_template
A Python project template.

## Includes
1. A Dev Container.
2. Visual Studio Code code quality extensions and configurations.
3. Pre-commit code quality configurations.
4. Dependabot configurations to update requirements.
5. A GitHub workflow which runs pre-commit on pull requests.

### Known Issues
1. All Visual Studio Code extensions may not be fully-operational immediately after the
Dev Container is built. This is a known issue with several related issues already
opened with Microsoft. To work around this issue, after the Dev Container is built,
navigate to the Command Palette and run the command `Developer: Reload Window`.
